# Content Collection Schema

The in-progress schema for configuring an advanced listing component (the Content Collection) for [Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple).

`schema.js` contains the working draft.

## Validation

- A [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) version will be implemented.
- https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv will eventually be implemented to test the schema.
